Creative infrastructure has hollowed out: galleries migrated to Vyner Street, independents replaced by corporate creative. The people who'd complain about a DJ set at 11pm live here now.",

A Boundary Estate 2-bed surfaces at £2,200 occasionally but is a unicorn. The coworking density is massive (WeWork, Ozone Coffee Roasters on Emma Street, Fix 126) but Marcel can access that from Bethnal Green for less money.

Good for culture, bad for Marcel's DJ sessions — dominant stock is Victorian terraces and tenements with poor sound insulation. Only pursue if a specific warehouse conversion on Cheshire Street or Ezra Street surfaces. Tower Hamlets borough: noise patrol Thu–Sun 8pm–3:30am, 5 officers for 5,000+ annual complaints — stretched thin but Marcel's midnight-ending sessions should be manageable in a well-insulated property.",

Columbia Road pushes 1-beds to £2,400+, above budget. 2-bed: £2,500–3,250, mostly above budget. Sunday market chaos disrupts one day per week (ground-floor WFH is a write-off 8am–3pm Sundays). Target Cheshire Street for best character-per-pound. Some converted factory/warehouse homes (private gated mews off Columbia Road) would be perfect for Marcel but are premium and rare — wait for one or focus effort on Bethnal Green/Haggerston instead."

No canal, no warehouses, no interesting architecture, no café culture. But: thick Victorian walls, quiet residential streets, outstanding multi-line transport. If Marcel prioritises a whole house for sound insulation and a dedicated DJ room over neighbourhood character, this is the most affordable path.
