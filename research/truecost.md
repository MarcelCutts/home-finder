## 1. Energy costs vary dramatically by EPC rating

Monthly energy bills for a London flat range from **£53 to £217** depending on EPC rating and flat size. The calculations below use the **Q1 2026 Ofgem price cap** (effective January–March 2026), announced 21 November 2025.

### Ofgem price cap unit rates used

| Component | Q1 2026 rate | Q1 2025 rate |
|---|---|---|
| Electricity unit rate | **27.69p/kWh** | ~27.44p/kWh |
| Gas unit rate | **5.93p/kWh** | ~5.97p/kWh |
| Electricity standing charge | **54.75p/day** (£200/yr) | ~53.56p/day |
| Gas standing charge | **35.09p/day** (£128/yr) | ~34.47p/day |
| **Total standing charges** | **£328/year (£27/month)** | ~£321/year |
| Headline annual cap (medium TDCV) | **£1,758** | ~£1,738 |

The Q2 2026 cap (April–June 2026) is forecast at ~£1,815, though the government's planned removal of the ECO levy from bills could reduce this by up to **£150/year**. The announcement is due 25 February 2026.

### Ofgem typical domestic consumption values (TDCVs)

| Profile | Electricity (kWh/yr) | Gas (kWh/yr) | Typical property |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Low** | 1,800 | 7,500 | Flat or 1-bed, 1–2 people |
| Medium | 2,700 | 11,500 | 3-bed house, 2–3 people |
| High | 4,100 | 17,500 | 5-bed house, 4–5 people |

The "Low" TDCV maps closely to an average-efficiency (EPC D) 1-bed flat. MoneyHelper reports the average flat/1-bed energy bill at **~£1,297/year (£108/month)**, which cross-validates against the EPC D figure below.

### Estimated consumption by EPC rating

Consumption was modelled using EPC energy-intensity bands (kWh/m²/year), London flat sizes of **42.5 m²** (1-bed) and **65 m²** (2-bed), and calibrated against the Ofgem Low TDCV for EPC D. The EPC bands correspond approximately to: A (≤25 kWh/m²/yr), B (26–50), C (51–75), D (76–100), E (101–125), F (126–150), G (151+).

**1-bed flat (42.5 m², gas central heating)**

| EPC | Gas (kWh/yr) | Elec (kWh/yr) | Gas bill (£/yr) | Elec bill (£/yr) | **Total (£/yr)** | **Total (£/month)** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | 1,500 | 800 | £217 | £421 | **£638** | **£53** |
| **B** | 3,000 | 1,200 | £306 | £532 | **£838** | **£70** |
| **C** | 5,000 | 1,500 | £425 | £615 | **£1,040** | **£87** |
| **D** | 7,500 | 1,800 | £573 | £698 | **£1,271** | **£106** |
| **E** | 10,000 | 2,000 | £721 | £754 | **£1,475** | **£123** |
| **F** | 13,000 | 2,200 | £899 | £809 | **£1,708** | **£142** |
| **G** | 17,000 | 2,500 | £1,136 | £892 | **£2,028** | **£169** |

**2-bed flat (65 m², gas central heating)**

| EPC | Gas (kWh/yr) | Elec (kWh/yr) | Gas bill (£/yr) | Elec bill (£/yr) | **Total (£/yr)** | **Total (£/month)** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | 2,200 | 1,200 | £259 | £532 | **£791** | **£66** |
| **B** | 4,500 | 1,700 | £395 | £671 | **£1,066** | **£89** |
| **C** | 7,000 | 2,100 | £543 | £781 | **£1,325** | **£110** |
| **D** | 9,500 | 2,500 | £691 | £892 | **£1,584** | **£132** |
| **E** | 13,000 | 2,800 | £899 | £975 | **£1,874** | **£156** |
| **F** | 17,000 | 3,100 | £1,136 | £1,058 | **£2,194** | **£183** |
| **G** | 22,000 | 3,500 | £1,433 | £1,169 | **£2,602** | **£217** |

**The gap between ratings is substantial.** Moving from EPC E to EPC C saves roughly **£36/month** on a 1-bed and **£46/month** on a 2-bed. Standing charges alone create a **£27/month floor** regardless of efficiency.

### Critical caveats for the calculator

- **Electric heating multiplier:** These figures assume gas central heating. Flats with electric panel/storage heaters (common in EPC E–G stock) can cost **50–100% more** because electricity is 4.7× the price of gas per kWh. Rightmove's tracker shows EPC G flats reaching £3,300–£6,000/year when electrically heated.
- **Seasonal variation:** Winter bills run 2–3× summer bills; the monthly figures above are annual averages.
- **London climate benefit:** London's milder winters mean gas consumption is typically 5–10% below national averages for equivalent properties.
- **Average London flat EPC is C**, versus the national average of D.

## 2. Thames Water charges for 2025–26

Water bills depend on whether the property is metered, unmetered (rateable value), or on assessed charges. The charging area matters too: **Area 2** covers Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest, and Newham; **Area 4** covers Haringey, with rates approximately **7–9% higher**.

### Metered volumetric rates (2025–26)

| Component | Rate |
|---|---|
| Water supply | **247.43p/m³** (£2.4743/m³) |
| Wastewater | **154.80p/m³** (£1.548/m³) |
| **Combined** | **402.23p/m³** (£4.0223/m³) |
| Water fixed charge | £63.96/year |
| Wastewater fixed charge | £130.22/year |
| **Total standing charges** | **£194.18/year** |

### Metered bill estimates

Consumption assumes **95 litres/person/day** for London flats (no gardens). One cubic metre equals 1,000 litres.

| Scenario | Occupants | m³/year | Volumetric cost | + Standing charges | **Annual** | **Monthly** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1-bed, 1 person | 1 | 36.5 | £147 | £194 | £341 | **£28** |
| 1-bed, 1.5 avg | 1.5 | 52 | £209 | £194 | £403 | **£34** |
| 1-bed, 2 people | 2 | 69.4 | £279 | £194 | £473 | **£39** |
| 2-bed, 2 people | 2 | 69.4 | £279 | £194 | £473 | **£39** |
| 2-bed, 2.5 avg | 2.5 | 86.7 | £349 | £194 | £544 | **£45** |
| 2-bed, 3 people | 3 | 104 | £418 | £194 | £613 | **£51** |

### Unmetered charges by area (rateable value billing)

Unmetered properties are billed by their frozen 1990 rateable value (RV). Typical RVs for East/North London flats: **1-bed ~£130**, **2-bed ~£185**.

| Property | RV | **Area 2 monthly** (Hackney/TH/WF/Newham) | **Area 4 monthly** (Haringey) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1-bed flat | £130 | **£43** | **£46** |
| 2-bed flat | £185 | **£55** | **£58** |

Area 2 rates: water 146.36p per £1 RV, wastewater 95.22p per £1 RV. Area 4 rates: water 159.74p, wastewater 101.90p. Both areas add unmetered fixed charges of £207.71/year.

### Assessed household charges (no meter, no RV)

| Bedrooms | Annual total | **Monthly** |
|---|---|---|
| 0–1 bedroom | £607 | **£51** |
| 2 bedrooms | £639 | **£53** |
| Single occupier | £536 | **£45** |

### Calculator median values

| Property | Metered median | Unmetered median | Recommended calculator default |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1-bed flat** | **£34/month** | £43–46/month | **£40/month** |
| **2-bed flat** | **£45/month** | £55–58/month | **£50/month** |

The **WaterSure cap** (£639/year, £53/month combined) is available for metered households on qualifying benefits with 3+ children or a medical condition requiring extra water. Thames Water's 2026–27 charges (from April 2026) increase by roughly **3.4%**.

## 3. Broadband costs across all major providers

East and North London has excellent fibre coverage. Community Fibre and Hyperoptic are particularly prevalent in the target postcodes. All prices below are broadband-only, excluding TV/phone bundles, checked February 2026.

### FTTP full fibre providers

**Community Fibre** (London-only, widespread in social housing and new builds across all target postcodes)

| Package | Speed | Monthly (in-contract) | Contract | Out-of-contract | Mid-contract rise |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Essential Fibre | 35 Mbps symmetric | **£15** | 12 months | +£4 | £2/mo each April |
| 150 Mbps | 150 Mbps symmetric | **£18** | 24 months | +£4 | £2/mo each April |
| 500 Mbps | 500 Mbps symmetric | **£20** | 24 months | +£4 | £2/mo each April |
| 1 Gbps | 920 Mbps symmetric | **£25** | 24 months | +£4 | £2/mo each April |

Community Fibre offers the cheapest full fibre in London with genuinely symmetric speeds (upload = download) and the lowest mid-contract rises at **£2/month** annually. No setup fees; free Wi-Fi 6 mesh router included.

**Hyperoptic** (common in apartment buildings)

| Package | Speed | Monthly (24-mo) | After April 2026 | Out-of-contract | Setup |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fast 50 | 50 Mbps symmetric | **£20** | £24 | ~£40–50 | £19 |
| Superfast 150 | 159 Mbps symmetric | **£26** | £30 | ~£50–60 | £19 |
| Hyperfast 1Gb | 900 Mbps symmetric | **£29** | £33 | ~£60 | £19 |

Mid-contract rise: **£4/month each April** (new from 2025/26 contracts). Social tariff (Fair Fibre): from £15/month.

**BT, Vodafone, Sky full fibre**

| Provider | Entry FTTP speed | Monthly (24-mo) | Mid-contract rise |
|---|---|---|---|
| **BT** Full Fibre 1 | 36 Mbps | **£30** | £4/mo on 31 March |
| **BT** Full Fibre 500 | 500 Mbps | **£32** | £4/mo on 31 March |
| **Vodafone** | 74 Mbps | **£25** | £3.50/mo each April |
| **Vodafone** 910 | 910 Mbps | **£33** | £3.50/mo each April |
| **Sky** Full Fibre 150 | 145 Mbps | **£25** | £3/mo from April 2026 |
| **Sky** Gigafast | 900 Mbps | **£38** | £3/mo from April 2026 |

### FTTC fibre to cabinet (36–80 Mbps)

| Provider | Speed | Monthly (in-contract) | Out-of-contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Vodafone** Fibre 1 | 37 Mbps | **£23** | Higher |
| **TalkTalk** Fibre 35 | 38 Mbps | **£24** | Higher |
| **Plusnet** Standard Fibre | 66 Mbps | **£25** | ~£40 |
| **NOW Broadband** Super Fibre | 63 Mbps | **£25** | Higher |
| **Sky** Superfast | 61 Mbps | **£27** | ~£40 |
| **BT** Fibre Essential | 36 Mbps | **£29** | ~£36 |

### Virgin Media cable (broadband-only, in-contract)

| Package | Speed | Monthly (24-mo) | Out-of-contract | Mid-contract rise |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M125 | 132 Mbps | **£17** | **£44–50** | £4/mo each April |
| M500 | 516 Mbps | **£21** | **£55–60** | £4/mo each April |
| Gig1 | 1,130 Mbps | **£24** | **£62** | £4/mo each April |

Virgin's out-of-contract prices nearly **triple** — this is the single biggest broadband cost trap for renters who forget to renegotiate.

### ADSL and copper switch-off

Standard ADSL (~10 Mbps) costs ~£27–30/month from BT. The copper PSTN switch-off deadline has been extended to **31 January 2027**. Stop-sell on new ADSL lines already applies to 1,281 exchanges covering 12.5 million premises. FTTC continues via SOGEA (no phone line needed) post-switch-off. ADSL is effectively irrelevant for new London tenancies.

### Mid-contract price rise summary (new contracts, Feb 2026)

| Provider | Annual rise | When applied |
|---|---|---|
| **Community Fibre** | **£2/month** | Each April |
| **Sky** | **£3/month** | Each April |
| **Vodafone** | **£3.50/month** | Each April |
| **BT / EE / Plusnet** | **£4/month** | 31 March |
| **Virgin Media** | **£4/month** | Each April |
| **TalkTalk** | **£4/month** | Each April |
| **Hyperoptic** | **£4/month** | Each April |

Ofcom banned inflation-linked (CPI + X%) rises for new contracts from 17 January 2025. Legacy contracts may still use CPI + 3.9%.

### Calculator defaults

| Tier | Typical monthly cost |
|---|---|
| Budget (FTTC/basic fibre) | **£23–28** |
| Mid-range (100–300 Mbps FTTP/cable) | **£18–28** |
| Fast (500 Mbps+) | **£20–35** |
| Gigabit | **£24–42** |
| **Recommended median** | **£25/month** |

## 4. Service charges differ enormously by property type

Service charges are the most variable cost in the calculator. The **Hamptons Service Charge Index 2024** found the average London service charge hit **£2,581/year (£215/month)**, rising **11% year-on-year** — four times faster than CPI. Nationally, 51% of leaseholders now pay more in service charges than council tax.

Key Hamptons findings: a lift adds a **16% premium**, a gym adds **24%**, and a concierge adds **39%**. Blocks of 20+ flats average £2,606/year — 99% more than blocks under 5 flats. The English Housing Survey 2023–24 reports a more conservative London flat median of **£1,865/year**.

### Monthly median estimates by property type

| Property type | Low | **Median** | High | What's included | Common postcodes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **New-build (post-2015)** | £200 | **£300** | £450+ | Concierge, gym, lifts, landscaping, communal heating, CCTV, building insurance, reserve fund, Building Safety Act compliance | E2, E3, E9, E15 |
| **Purpose-built (pre-2003)** | £100 | **£150** | £220 | Building insurance, communal cleaning, lift maintenance, grounds, management | All postcodes |
| **Purpose-built (post-2003)** | £150 | **£210** | £300 | As above plus modern fire safety systems, better communal facilities | E3, E10, E15, E17 |
| **Warehouse/industrial conversion** | £130 | **£220** | £380 | Varies hugely: basic conversion = insurance + minimal maintenance; managed development = full amenity package | E2, E8, E9 |
| **Ex-council flat** | £80 | **£130** | £200 | Caretaking, communal lighting, lift, grounds, building insurance, management (Hackney: £385/yr management charge). **No sinking fund** — major works billed separately | All postcodes |
| **Victorian/Edwardian conversion** | £50 | **£85** | £150 | Building insurance (often the largest item), communal hallway/staircase, external maintenance. Minimal services; often share of freehold | E5, E8, E17, N15, N16 |
| **Georgian conversion** | £55 | **£100** | £170 | As Victorian but potentially higher due to listed building requirements and specialist contractors | E2, E8, N16 |

### Specific listing data points from the target postcodes

- E15 Stratford shared ownership listings show service charges of **£182–£496/month** for new builds
- E8 Hackney, Quebec Wharf warehouse conversion (2-bed): **£270/month**
- E3 Bow Quarter factory conversion with pool/gym/concierge: **£300–400+/month**
- Hackney Council 2025/26 leaseholder management charge: **£385/year** per leaseholder plus cleaning (up 11%), grounds (up 9%), repairs (up 3.1%), and insurance

### When service charges should raise alarm

| Property type | Monthly "alarm" threshold |
|---|---|
| New-build with amenities | >£450 (unless pool/spa/24hr concierge) |
| Purpose-built (older) | >£250 |
| Warehouse conversion | >£350 |
| Ex-council | >£200 (and ask about pending major works) |
| Victorian/Edwardian conversion | >£150 |

Red flags include charges rising more than **10–15% annually**, no itemised breakdown provided, artificially low charges on new developments (developers sometimes suppress initial charges then hike after 2–3 years), pending Section 20 major works notices on ex-council stock (can be **£10,000–£50,000+** per flat), and unresolved cladding/fire safety issues (buildings insurance has risen **92%** since 2019 on 18m+ buildings).

## 5. Council tax: confirmed 2025–26 rates for all five boroughs

All rates below include the **GLA precept** (Band D: £490.38, up 4.03% from 2024–25) and are confirmed from official council publications. Tower Hamlets remains the cheapest; Waltham Forest the most expensive.

### Band A (typical for 1-bed flats)

| Borough | Annual | **Monthly** | With 25% SPD monthly | Council increase |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tower Hamlets** (E2, E3) | £1,170 | **£97** | **£73** | 4.99% |
| **Newham** (E15) | £1,237 | **£103** | **£77** | 8.99%* |
| **Hackney** (E5, E8, E9, N16) | £1,311 | **£109** | **£82** | 4.9% |
| **Haringey** (N15, N17) | £1,472 | **£123** | **£92** | ~4.99% |
| **Waltham Forest** (E10, E17) | £1,518 | **£127** | **£95** | 4.99% |

### Band B (typical for 2-bed flats)

| Borough | Annual | **Monthly** | With 25% SPD monthly |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tower Hamlets** | £1,365 | **£114** | **£85** |
| **Newham** | £1,444 | **£120** | **£90** |
| **Hackney** | £1,530 | **£127** | **£96** |
| **Haringey** | £1,717 | **£143** | **£107** |
| **Waltham Forest** | £1,772 | **£148** | **£111** |

### Band C and Band D

| Borough | Band C monthly | Band D monthly |
|---|---|---|
| **Tower Hamlets** | £130 | £146 |
| **Newham** | £137 | £155 |
| **Hackney** | £146 | £164 |
| **Haringey** | £164 | £184 |
| **Waltham Forest** | £169 | £190 |

*Newham received special government permission for an **8.99%** rise (6.99% + 2% adult social care precept) due to severe financial pressures from the highest temporary accommodation costs in London. Despite this, it remains the 7th lowest council tax in London.

### Typical bands for flats

**1-bed flats** in these postcodes are usually **Band A or B** (Band A for ex-council and smaller conversions; Band B for newer-build 1-beds). **2-bed flats** are typically **Band B or C** (Band B for smaller 2-beds and ex-council; Band C for larger or newer-build 2-beds). Always verify via the VOA band checker at gov.uk/council-tax-bands.

### Special relief and reduction schemes

**Tower Hamlets** operates the most generous scheme: council tax is frozen for households earning under **£50,350** (the 2.99% general increase is offset), and those on the lowest incomes pay **no council tax at all**. Hackney's Council Tax Reduction Scheme requires a minimum 10% contribution (planned phase to 0% by 2030). Newham reduced its maximum discount from 90% to **80%** for working-age residents in 2025–26. All boroughs offer the statutory **25% single person discount**.

---

## 6. Hidden costs renters commonly overlook

### Contents insurance

| Property | Monthly range | Recommended median |
|---|---|---|
| 1-bed flat | £5–£10 | **£8/month** |
| 2-bed flat | £8–£15 | **£12/month** |

The UK average is £129/year (ABI data, mid-2025). London premiums run higher due to crime and flood risk. Key budget providers for renters: Lemonade, Urban Jungle. Adding accidental damage costs ~£14/year extra; bicycle cover ~£45/year.

### TV licence

The current 2025–26 rate is **£174.50/year (£14.54/month)**. From 1 April 2026, this rises to **£180/year (£15/month)** — a 3.14% CPI-linked increase. Required for anyone watching live TV on any channel or using BBC iPlayer. Households that exclusively use non-BBC streaming services (Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, ITVX/Channel 4 catch-up only) do **not** need a licence.

### Parking permits: emissions-based pricing across all five boroughs

Every borough now uses emissions-based pricing, making this a potentially massive hidden cost. **Hackney** has the most aggressive 13-band structure.

| Borough | EV/zero-emission | Mid-range petrol (~120g/km) | High-emission diesel (200g+/km) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hackney** | **£52/yr** | £136/yr | **£596–£896/yr** |
| **Tower Hamlets** | **£38–79/yr** (by battery size) | £106/yr | **£497/yr** + £74 diesel surcharge |
| **Haringey** | **~£34/yr** | £79/yr | **£170+/yr** + £100 diesel surcharge |
| **Waltham Forest** | **£45/yr** | £60/yr | **£185/yr** |
| **Newham** | Lowest band (~£60/yr) | ~£60/yr | Higher bands + **£100 diesel surcharge** (from June 2025) |

The gap is stark: an EV costs **£3–7/month** to park, while a high-emission diesel can cost **£50–75/month** in Hackney. Second-vehicle surcharges of £50–86/year apply in most boroughs. Hackney's diesel surcharge rises £50/year — by 2027/28, the worst-case permit could reach **£1,243/year**.

### Cycle hangar storage

A cycle hangar space costs **£38–72/year** (£3–6/month) depending on borough. Hackney charges £53/year on-street or £38/year on estates. Cyclehoop (operating across most boroughs) charges a standard £72/year. The critical issue is availability: over **50,000 people** are on waiting lists across London, with typical waits of **1–3+ years** in East and North London. Hackney has the highest number of hangars in London but still reports demand far exceeding supply.

### Communal/district heating: the unregulated cost trap

Heat networks are **very common in new-build flats in E2, E3, and E15** (Stratford's Olympic legacy developments are heavily heat-networked). These are **not covered by the Ofgem price cap** — this is the most significant hidden cost for new-build renters.

| Metric | Standard gas | Heat network (typical) | Heat network (worst cases) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit rate | **5.93p/kWh** (Ofgem cap) | **6–10p/kWh** typical | Up to **77p/kWh** reported |
| Standing charge | £128/year | Varies widely | Can be higher |
| Monthly premium over gas | — | **£7–£30+** (1-bed) | £50–100+ |

Heat Trust, the independent consumer-protection scheme, has documented cases where heat network customers pay **double** equivalent gas-heated households. Ofgem was appointed as heat network regulator and statutory regulation is being **phased in from January 2026**, but no price cap has been introduced yet. Renters viewing new-build flats should specifically ask whether the property is on a heat network, as you **cannot switch supplier**.

### One-off move-in costs

| Cost | 1-bed (£1,400/mo rent) | 2-bed (£1,700/mo rent) |
|---|---|---|
| Holding deposit (1 week) | **£323** | **£392** |
| Tenancy deposit (5 weeks) | **£1,615** | **£1,962** |
| Man & van | **£150–£300** | **£250–£500** |
| End-of-tenancy cleaning | **£200** | **£300** |
| Royal Mail redirection (6 months) | **£47** | **£47** |
| **Total move-in** | **£2,335–£2,485** | **£2,951–£3,201** |

Deposit calculation: weekly rent = monthly rent × 12 ÷ 52. The Tenant Fees Act 2019 caps the deposit at 5 weeks' rent and the holding deposit at 1 week. Landlords cannot mandate a specific cleaning company. Royal Mail redirection costs £34 (3 months), £47 (6 months), or £67 (12 months), with a concession rate for Universal Credit/Pension Credit recipients.

### Laundry costs for flats without washing machines

Many Victorian conversions and older ex-council flats in these postcodes lack space for a washing machine. London laundrette costs run **15–20% above** the national average.

| Service | Cost |
|---|---|
| Standard wash (8–9 kg) | £5.50–£8 |
| Dryer (standard load) | £3–£4 |
| **Total wash + dry** | **£8.50–£12 per load** |
| Service wash (wash, dry, fold) | £12–£20 |

At 1–2 loads per week, this adds **£35–£100/month** — a significant and frequently overlooked expense. A portable/tabletop washing machine (£50–£150) can dramatically reduce this if the flat has a suitable water connection.

## Conclusion: assembling the full picture

The total non-rent cost of renting in East and North London extends well beyond the headline figure. For a **1-bed flat in EPC C** with typical services, the monthly outgoings stack up to approximately:

| Category | Typical monthly cost |
|---|---|
| Energy (EPC C) | £87 |
| Water (metered) | £34 |
| Council tax Band A (Hackney) | £109 |
| Broadband (mid-range FTTP) | £25 |
| Contents insurance | £8 |
| TV licence | £15 |
| **Subtotal (without service charge)** | **£278** |
| Service charge (Victorian conversion) | +£85 |
| Service charge (new-build) | +£300 |

That **£278–£578/month** in non-rent costs is before any parking, laundry, or heat network premiums. The single largest variable is the service charge, which ranges from £50/month (share-of-freehold Victorian conversion) to £450+/month (amenity-rich new build). The single largest hidden cost is the heat network premium in new builds, which is both unregulated and unavoidable. Tower Hamlets offers the lowest council tax and the most generous relief scheme — a genuine saving of **£30–50/month** versus Waltham Forest or Haringey at equivalent bands. For broadband, Community Fibre delivers the best value in these postcodes at £15–25/month with symmetric speeds and the lowest annual rises. Every figure above is drawn from official 2025–26 tariffs, regulator data, or industry indices and is suitable for direct use in a rental cost calculator.
